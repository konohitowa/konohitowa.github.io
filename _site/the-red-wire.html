<h3 id="the-red-wire">The Red Wire</h3>

<p>If you insist on ignoring my advice, then go ahead and attach the red wire (or whatever your +5V wire is) to <a href="http://pinout.xyz/pinout/pin2_5v_power">Pin 2 - 5v Power</a>. You could have used pin 4, but keeping power and ground separated a bit helps reduce the odds of accidental contact between them.</p>

<h1 id="caution-do-not-connect-both-the-serial-adapters-5v-power-red-wire-and-the-microusb-power-cable-in-at-the-same-time-you-can-short-out-your-system-and-damage-it">CAUTION! DO <strong>NOT</strong> CONNECT BOTH THE SERIAL ADAPTER’S 5V POWER (RED WIRE) AND THE MICROUSB POWER CABLE IN AT THE SAME TIME! YOU CAN SHORT OUT YOUR SYSTEM AND DAMAGE IT!</h1>

<h3 id="obviously-they-both-have-to-also-be-connected-to-power-at-the-same-time-for-this-to-happen-but-all-the-same-dont-have-them-both-plugged-into-the-board-its-really-easy-to-lose-track-of-what-youre-doing-and-apply-power-to-both-simultaneously">Obviously they both have to also be connected to power at the same time for this to happen, but all the same don’t have them both plugged into the board; it’s really easy to lose track of what you’re doing and apply power to both simultaneously.</h3>

<hr />

<p>So here’s the chicken and the egg part: in order to have the /dev/ttyUSB0 (or whatever it shows up as) device available to your serial console software, you’ll need to plug in the USB-TTL adapter. But if you’re also powering the 3B from the adapter, you’ll miss out on the startup info coming out of the serial port; hence my recommendation that you not power from the USB-TTL adapter. Being one to not follow my own advice, I actually do power from the USB-TTL adapter but I also use the Serial program on OS X which can handle the USB device disappearing and reappearing. Did I mention it was expensive? And that there may have been beer involved?</p>
